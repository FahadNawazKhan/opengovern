Imagine this — you walk past a broken streetlight every night. You’ve complained, tweeted, even tagged your city, but nothing changes.

Now imagine you open an app, snap a photo, hit submit — and that issue instantly lands on the right officer’s dashboard, gets assigned, and you can watch the fix in real time.

That’s OpenGov, where citizens become active participants, not passive complainers.

We built it with React + Vite for blazing-fast UX, Firebase for real-time updates, and Express to handle smart routing and scalable APIs.

In less than 6 hours, a small team can set it up for any community — from a college campus to an entire city ward.

Why now? Because transparency isn’t optional anymore — it’s demanded. We’re not just fixing roads; we’re rebuilding trust between people and systems.

So when I hand you this app — this isn’t just another codebase. This is the voice of every citizen who finally gets heard.

Objection: “Citizens won’t use it.” Reply: “We make reporting 30 seconds: snap, pin, submit. Plus we show progress — that visibility is the biggest motivator. People respond to results.”

Objection: “Municipalities already have systems.” Reply: “OpenGov integrates with minimal friction — start as a public-facing intake + dashboard. If your current system is buried, OpenGov becomes the visible front door that reduces duplicate entries and improves data quality to feed back into legacy systems.”

Objection: “How do you prevent spam?” Reply: “Phone/email verification + rate limits + duplicate detection. High-impact actions require verification; low-impact ideas can remain anonymous.”

Objection: “Who pays?” Reply: “Pilot sponsorship, subscription dashboards for city/campus admins, and premium analytics for budgeting — clear B2B revenue path after a successful pilot.
